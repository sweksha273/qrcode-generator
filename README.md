# qrcode-generator
from this repo we can create qrcodes for any video,image,text,google forms and many more.
it is basically based on basic or simple python library/module called qrcode by this we create a qrcode generator that can generate anything for you.
so for doing this or building this first we have to install a python module qrcode from using terminal and then after importing define a variable called img, giving this var. a function called make which functions to make qrcodes as images so as to scan and get the output.
but the thing that should be noticable is that we have to go to the folder and then files to get the img of qrcode to scan.
